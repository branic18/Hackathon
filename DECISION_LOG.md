# 75HER Challenge: Decision Log Template
Project Name: [Insert Project Name]
Team Name: [Insert Team Name]

## 💡 Purpose & Instructions
Purpose: Document your key technical choices and reasoning for judges. This helps them understand your engineering thinking.
Instructions:
For each major decision, record the choice made, the "Why," and the "Tradeoff".
Keep it punchy: Each entry should be 1-2 lines maximum.
Focus on: Architecture, tech stack, project scope changes, or selecting between multiple valid options.
Target: 5–10 key decisions minimum.

## 📝 Guidance for Success
### ✅ DO:
Be Specific: Use "React" instead of "frontend framework".
Quantify: Use "150KB bundle" instead of "large size".
Focus on Engineering: Avoid personal preferences; focus on technical requirements.
Acknowledge Tradeoffs: Every choice has a downside—be honest about what you accepted.
### ❌ DON'T:
List Every Library: Only include the "needle-movers".
Justify Obvious Choices: Don't explain why you used Git or a code editor.
Write Essays: Keep the judges' time in mind; stay concise.

## ✅ Submission Checklist
- [ ] At least 5 decisions documented.
- [ ] Every decision has a clear, specific tradeoff.
- [ ] Decisions reflect choices made DURING the hackathon.
- [ ] Organized by category (Tech Stack, Architecture, etc.).
- [ ] File saved as DECISION_LOG.md in the /docs/ folder.
